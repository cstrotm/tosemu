TOSEMU
An emulated environment to TOS applications.

Introduction
============

TOSEMU aims to provide an emulated environment for executing TOS applications. 
Instead of emulating a complete TOS-compatible machine, operating system calls 
are intercepted and emulated on the host platform. The end result will be TOS 
applications running as an integrated part of the host system.

TOSEMU can be seen as a mix of 68kemu, which allows 68k applications to be 
executed in a TOS environment on another CPU platform, and wine, which lets 
Windows applications execute using a system API translation laer on the CPU 
platform they where meant for. TOSEMU executes 68k applications on non-68k 
CPUs, and provides an OS wrapper layer, translating TOS calls to system calls 
native to the host operating system.



Building
========

TOSEMU is self contained for now, so a simple `make` should do it. The resulting 
binary can be found in the bin directory.

The `make clean` target produces a clean source tree.



Usage
=====

TOSEMU takes a single command line argument, the location of a TOS application. 
It is also possible to use TOSEMU with the binfmt support in the Linux kernel. I
 use the following line to enable this:

  `echo ':tos:M::\x60\x1a:\xff\xff:/path/to/binary/tosemu:' | sudo tee /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register`

This will allow you to execute TOS binaries as if they where native.



Road Map
========

The first stage will be to get a very basic TOS application to execute using 
TOSEMU. Having achieved this, more and more complex apps will be supported by 
extending the available system calls.

When basic applications are useable, a server/client architecture enabling 
intra-app communication as well as desktop accessory applications will be 
implemented.



Tests
=====

The tests subdirectory contains test applications used during the development 
of tosemu. The tests are compiled with the m68k-atari-mint cross-tools built by
 Vincent RiviÃ¨re. Please visit the following web site for more information:

  http://vincent.riviere.free.fr/soft/m68k-atari-mint/

To build the tests, simply run make tests, this will result in a set of binaries
named test-* in the tests sub-directory.



Licensing
=========

TOSEMU is available under a GPLv2 license. Please refer to the source code and 
the COPYING file for further details.
