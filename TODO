- Setup a large memory area with the stack pointer at the top, holding the address to the basepage
- Copy the binary data into the large memory area
- Catch the trap calls, turning them into host calls
- Avoid reading from 0x0 addresses at the very start
- Make the execution loop infinite, but keep an "exception" flag to terminate it
- Move the whole execution loop into the tossystem module
