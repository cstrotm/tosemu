- Avoid reading from 0x0 addresses at the very start
- Make the execution loop infinite, but keep an "exception" flag to terminate it
- Move the whole execution loop into the tossystem module
- Looks as if many parts of this will have to be implemented:

- Have a long good look at supervisor mode and how to handle it. For instance, XBIOS Supexec is scary.
- Change GEMDOS and XBIOS implementations to use tables with function pointers so that each function is a separate function, and so that proper names can be returned in error messages, e.g. GEMDOS MShrink, not 0x4f.
